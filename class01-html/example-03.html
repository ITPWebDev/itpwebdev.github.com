    Background
    The first museums were called Cabinets of Wonder. Usually, a viewer with a guide, often the collector, would open doors and drawers to see what was inside--amazing things from different parts of the world, different times. They were windows on the world to places the visitors would probably never be able to go; to see things they would never otherwise be able to see. Museums were a great experiment in learning in a public place, a 3D space? How is that different from learning in a classroom? Is learning still a primary goal?
    And now there’s television, movies, the internet and travel. Why do people go to museums now? Will they in the future? Today, most museums seek to educate and to include more and more diverse visitors than they used to. How do people learn in public spaces? How do we know that they do? How can they make use of the new interactive technologies and not lose what’s special about them?
    If you were inventing a museum today, what would it look like? Who would be there? What would its main purpose be?
    Because of a very different kind of Cabinet of Wonder, i.e. the computer and other IT technologies, museums are able to display collections, demonstrate concepts, and reach their audiences in new ways. Most have not taken full advantage of these new tools or had the time to explore how they might change the nature of a museum visit or even what their role is in the 21st century. We’ll discuss ways in which technology may enhance the museum experience; evaluate their use of interactive technologies. But more important than the technology of buttons and kiosks, is how our technological age has changed the purpose.

    Overview
    The class is an exploration, observation and theory class with some design mixed in. Museum and exhibit visits are your primary assignments for the first half of the course— sometimes accompanied by a reading. Usually you will also make some record of our visit. Often someone from the assigned museum will come to class, make a presentation and receive your questions and critique. In the second half of the course, you begin to imagine how you might reinvent a museum.
    The real topic of this course is designing experience, creating engagement with a topic. I call that interactive design whether it has technology involved or not. But we do
    document together the ways in which technology may enhance the museum experience. We evaluate the use of interactive technologies in museums and how that experience might be extended online. But first we observe and study what they do now. We cannot invent a new wheel before we understand the old one. In this course we explore the different kinds of exhibits in museums (object-based collection, demonstrations of phenomena), historic or single topic museums (e.g. The Tenement Museum) and the varied kinds of venues for exhibits (museums, trade shows, traveling, nature centers) Students learn through experience and discussion a brief history of museums and exhibitions, discover criteria for informal learning environments that differ from school room learning.
    And though we focus on museums...we also look at exhibits, and other public displays of information. Assignments include field trips to museums, readings, writing, making stuff and imagining and designing your own museum or exhibit. This year there will be more emphasis on design than in previous years.

    Each week, in addition to your visit you will report on what you saw and what you think about it in a variety of ways: writing, making, sketching.
    You will develop your own ideas of what makes for a powerful, interactive, learning experience in a public setting. About mid-way through the course, I will ask you to write your own ‘manifesto’ of what you think that is.
    Then I will give you a very generous budget (with imaginary dollars) and you will develop your own Cabinet of Wonders, an exhibit or museum idea, based on your manifesto of what makes a good exhibit or museum experience. First you will make
    a general presentation of the idea, receive crit from the class. Then you will refine that
    idea, and develop in more detail a few interactions, a floor plan, the ‘case statement’ you’d put out to raise money or generate excitement.
    September 8—Class 1
    Class: Introduction: What are Museums for? Who are Museums For?
    All Learning is Interactive: True or False?
    While I am giving an overview of the class and some issues to consider...think about the following and be ready to discuss:
    • do you go to museums and exhibits? why? what do you like about them? what don’t you like about them? What was your basic childhood museum (field trip at school, outing with family,etc.)
    • have you ever collected anything? what and why?
    Assignment:
    • Get a Journal/Sketchbook: (to record your visits, ideas, etc. while you are out and about)
    • Visit: (choose 2) Cooper-Hewitt, Museum of the City of New York, El Museo del Barrio, Studio Museum of Harlem, The Jewish Museum. Make notes/sketches in your sketchbook: who’s there, how crowded, how are you greeted, how are people interacting (or are they?). You can do a quick walk-through, but look for one thing that catches your eye. Stand in front of it for a while, draw it. Upload/enter what you’re willing to share on the class blog.
    • Readings: Grover and the Everything in the Whole Wide World Museum, Educational Theory (I’ve noted what to skim, what to read more deeply––keep on hand.)
